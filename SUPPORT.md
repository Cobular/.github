# How to Get Support

> This is a generic support file for all my repositories. It probably applies to this one you're viewing right now, this is just worth noting!

Hi! So you're stuck with something, or need some kind of help with something, is that right? Cool! You've come to the right place. 

Most of the support for my stuff comes through a discord server. The link is down below, but **before you just click that**, let's see if you should make an issue or something else instead.

1. Is this a bug report or something of that sort?
    * Please open an issue, it's better to track those sorts of things there.
2. Is this asking about a PR to see if it'd be accepted?
    * Join if you want, since it's easier to have a discussion there, but please make a PR and describe what you want to do and I'll let you know if it seems like a good fit for the project
    * Also, please see the CONTRIBUTING.md for the specific project you're looking at for more information, as that overrides this.
3. Do you need help getting set up or working with this project?
    * Sure, join the discord and ask for help! Please note that I don't have much time these days, and I might not respond very fast / at all to your request for support. It's nothing personal for sure, but please try to look at other resources like examples and documentation first.

Cool. Now you're still sure the discord is the right place? Cool. Here's the link: [https://discord.com/rEdQVpQ](https://discord.com/rEdQVpQ)

See you there!
